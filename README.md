Software Development in Java: Lab 3

If you are having difficulties getting the data to load, make sure that the files are in the correct place. 
All .java files should be placed in "src" directory.
The .csv file MUST be placed in the project directory (The same folder as "src".)
Additionally, IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO LOAD THE PROJECT, IT'S BECAUSE THE .CSV I UPLOADED WAS THE WRONG ONE :(
You can either remove the category labels, or use the new one I just uploaded. Please don't take points from me :(

It's not perfect, but it generally meets the requirements.
